**** Space War: Card Game ****

- This game uses one deck of 52 playing cards.

- The card's value depends on the number on its face with royal cards having the following values: Ace = 14, King = 13, Queen = 12, Jack = 11.

- The Player's card is displayed on the left.

- The Computer's card is displayed on the right.

- Clicking the "Attack!" button executes the game.

- The top card of the deck is assigned to the Player.

- The second card of the deck is assigned to the Computer.

- Whoever has the higher card value is determined to be the winner.

- If both card values are the same, this results in a tie.

- Once the winner or tie is determined, a new deck is shuffled and the game starts over.
