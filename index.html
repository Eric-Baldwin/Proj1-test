        <p2 id="instructions">- This game uses one deck of 52 playing cards.
<br>
            - The card's value depends on the number on its face with royal cards having the following values: Ace = 14, King = 13, Queen = 12, Jack = 11.
            <br>
            - The Player's card is displayed on the left.
            <br>
            - The Computer's card is displayed on the right.
            <br>
            - Clicking the "Attack!" button executes the game.
            <br>
            - The top card of the deck is assigned to the Player.
            <br>
            - The second card of the deck is assigned to the Computer.
            <br>
            - Whoever has the higher card value is determined to be the winner.
            <br>
            - If both card values are the same, this results in a tie.
            <br>
            - Once the winner or tie is determined, a new deck is shuffled and the game starts over.</p2>
